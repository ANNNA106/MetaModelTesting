# General Information
This repository contains the source code for the experiments of the paper "Test Selection for Deep Neural Networks using Meta-Models with Uncertainty Metrics".

# Repository Structure 
The package is organized into the following directories:

- [analysis](analysis): This directory includes the evaluation methods for assessing the effectiveness of test data prioritization techniques in identifying fault-revealing test data. 
- [datamodels](datamodels): This directory contains the DNN models used in the experiments. 
- [imagegeneration](imagegeneration): This directory holds the source code used to generate test data. 
- [selectionmethods](selectionmethods): This directory features the test data prioritization methods, encompassing both our meta-model-based test prioritization method and the baseline methods used for comparison. 

The main file for conducting experiments with test data prioritization methods is TestMetricAnalysis.py.
